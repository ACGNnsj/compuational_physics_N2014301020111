## 1.Abstract

There are a massive examples about chaos, good understanding of them is very useful for us to predict some normal but interesting in our
daily life.

### Problem 3.30
Investigate the Lyapunov exponent of the stadium billiard for several values of 
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\alpha" alt="" title="" />. You can do this qualitatively by examining the 
behavior for only one set of initial conditions for each value of 
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\alpha" alt="" title="" />you consider, or more quantitatively by averaging over a range of
initial conditions for each value of <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\alpha" alt="" title="" />
