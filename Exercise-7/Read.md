## 1.Abstract

Oscillatory phenomena can be found in many areas of physics, including the motion of electrons in atoms, the behavior of currents and 
voltages in electronic circuits, and planetary orbits. But the simplist one may be the motion of pendulums. Through analying this simple 
example, we will have a better understanding of oscillatory motion and chaos. Chaos theory is the field of study in mathematics that 
studies the behavior of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions. Small differences in initial conditions 
yield widely diverging outcomes for such dynamical sysytems, rendering long-term prediction impossible in general. In this homework, 
I will mainly talk about effects of initial conditions to chaos and some points about strange attractors.

In constructing the Poincare section in Figure 3.9 we plotted points only at times that were in phaes with the drive force; that is at time
